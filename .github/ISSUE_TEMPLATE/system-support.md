**Your System**
Please link your system here and give me the name. Also open the console in Foundry (F12) and type `game.system.id` followed by enter. Give me the output here.

**What (doesn't) work?**
Please describe the IR feature that doesn't work in your system.

**Additional context**
If you know how/what that is, please list the hooks that are called in the console IR doesn't know yet. Doing this will help immensely.
