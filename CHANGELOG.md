## [Unreleased]
## [1.0.1] - 2022-08-21
☮️ Peace in the world, or the world in pieces. 🕊️
### Fixed
- Chat message notification not playing.
### Changed
- Changes to translation strings to reflect recent changes.
- Chat message notifications won't play for the user who sends them anymore.
- Added min and compatible core version to the manifest used by FVTT core v9 and earlier to get rid of the warning in v9.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-08-21
### Added
- v10 and v9 backwards compatibility.
- A way to select a single file instead of a folder.
- A way to set up wildcard files using asterisk (*). A file path with an asterisk will automatically be treated as a wildcard path. The asterisk acts as a placeholder similar to the way wildcard token images are handled by core.
- New translation strings, other were edited.
- A help button with useful information was added to the setup dialogues.
- Setup dialogues slightly resized in width.
- Drastically reduced the text in setup dialogues (the information can now be found when pressing the help button).
- Added a second button to select folders while the original button only accepts files.
- The setting for the chat message now relies on core file picker instead of using Settings Extender.
### Removed
- Dependency for Settings Extender removed.
### Changed
- Changed the message notification file picker to foundry native one.
- Changed manifest to fit Foundry v10.
- Whisper messages are no longer affected by the IR sound. IR will neither change the default whisper sound nor will it play its sound when a whisper message is sent.
- Chat message notification defaults to `sounds/notify.wav` which is the core sound for whispers.
### Fixed
- The chat message notification now only plays for the current user. Previously it played on all accounts *for* all accounts.
- IR will no longer play its chat notification sound on a whisper message (*for everyone*).
