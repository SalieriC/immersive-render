From a folder path, a random audio file is picked to play when the entities sheet is rendered (opened) and closed.</p><p>Simply open the contextual menu (right click on Windows and Linux) of any Actor, Item, Journal or Folder of these (for batch editing) in the sidebar and select the IR option.</p><p>Please note that currently you need to grant users permission to browse files for them to hear the audio file played*. Make sure to grant them this permission in Core Settings -> Permission Configurator.</p><p>There is also a setting for IR that lets you configure a single audio file to be played when a new message is send in the chat.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should only pick (folders with) very short audio files. Once they play, they play until they end. You've been warned.</p><p>*Dev talk: I considered using sockets to circumvent this but that would only work if a GM is logged in and I didn't want this as a(nother) restriction. Maybe there is a good way around this. I am working on it but if you know one, feel free to open a Pull Request or Issue on the <a href='https://github.com/SalieriC/immersive-render'>repository</a>.
